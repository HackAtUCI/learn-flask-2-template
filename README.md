# learn-flask-with-hack template

## Introduction
Flask is a simple but powerful Python web framework. In this workshop, we'll be making an app that reads from a MongoDB database and displays the contents, with an add function that allows users to add more entries to display. 

## Prerequisites
- Install Python
- Install Pip
- Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the command line

## Key Learning Points
1. Defining routes and navigating between routes
2. Jinjas2 templating for injecting data into html pages
3. Processing data from forms in the backend
